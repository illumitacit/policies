title: "Privacy Policy"
---

*Last updated: May 28th, 2023*

The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out:

* what data we collect and why
* how your data is handled
* and your rights with respect to your data.

We promise we will not sell your data. Never have. Never will.

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. You can view a
history of the changes to our policies [on
GitHub](https://github.com/illumitacit/policies/commits/main/content/privacy.md). Whenever we make a significant change
to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take any other appropriate steps to notify users.


## What We Collect and Why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice:

### Identity & Access

When you join the IllumiTacit waiting list, we ask for your email address so we can keep you updated with
product news and private beta access. We might also reach out for a live interview to better understand
your needs. You can easily unsubscribe at any time through the email links.

When you sign up for IllumiTacit, we request details like your name, email address, and possibly a company
name to personalize your account and share important updates with you. Occasionally, we may send
optional surveys to learn more about your experience and enhance our products. With your approval, we'll
send our newsletter and other updates too. You may also choose to add a profile picture for display within
our products. You can change your notification settings anytime via email links or on your account settings
page.

Rest assured, we will never sell your personal information to third parties, nor will we use your name or company
in marketing materials without your permission.

### Billing Information

When you join IllumiTacit, we'll ask for your payment details and billing address. Your credit card information
goes straight to our payment processor, not passing through IllumiTacit servers. We save a record of the
transaction, including the last 4 digits of your credit card, to help with account history, invoicing, and billing
support.

We keep your billing address to charge you for our service, figure out any sales tax, send invoices, and spot any
fraudulent transactions. Sometimes, we use combined billing data to improve our marketing. Don't worry, we're
committed to keeping your information safe and secure.

### Product Interactions

We store the content you provide when creating Macros and Inputs in your IllumiTacit account on our servers.
This helps you use our products as they're designed, like running prompts with third-party language models.
We keep this content while the Macros and Inputs are active, and while your account is active. All related data is
deleted within 60 days, including from backups, when the Macro and Input is deleted. If you delete your account, we'll
erase the content within 60 days.

We also store the content uploaded during model experimentation ("Experiments" in the app) in your IllumiTacit account
on our servers. This content is used to retain the history of the model exchanges to assist you in Macro creation. We
keep this content while the Experiments are retained in your account. All related data is deleted within 60 days,
including from backups, when the Experiment is deleted. If you delete your account, we'll erase the content within 60
days.

We don't store content uploaded during runtime execution of Macros and Plugins on our servers. However, our
[third party service providers](#when-we-access-or-share-your-information), might keep this content. For
example, OpenAI stores content used for their language model for up to 30 days to detect abuse.

To learn more about how each service provider uses your data, please refer to their
[policies](#when-we-access-or-share-your-information)

### Geolocation Data

We log the IP address you use to sign up for a product account to prevent spammy signups. We also log all
account access by IP address for security and fraud prevention purposes, and we keep this login data as long as
your account is active.

### Website Analytics

We use [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) to track overall trends in the usage of our website. Plausible
Analytics collects only aggregated information, which does not allow us to identify any visitor to our website. For more
information, please visit the [Plausible Analytics Data Policy](https://plausible.io/privacy).

### Anti-Bot Assessments

We proxy our service through [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to mitigate brute force and DDoS attacks. We have
a legitimate interest in protecting our apps and the broader Internet community from credential stuffing
attacks and spam. When you access IllumiTacit, Cloudflare evaluates various information (e.g., IP address, how long the
visitor has been on the app, mouse movements) to try to detect if the activity is from an automated program instead of a
human. We retain these data via our subprocessor indefinitely for use in spam mitigation.

We also use [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/) across our service to mitigate spam
entries for forms. When you fill in certain forms, the CAPTCHA service evaluates various information (e.g., IP address,
how long the visitor has been on the app, mouse movements) to try to detect if the activity is from an automated program
instead of a human. These data is also retained via our subprocessor indefinitely for use in spam mitigation. The data
collected is minimal, and no cookie information is used for this purpose.

For more information, please visit the [How Cloudflare works
page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/), [Cloudflare Turnstile
documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile), and the [Cloudflare Privacy
Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

### Cookies

We use persistent first-party cookies and some third-party cookies to store login sessions, certain preferences, make it
easier for you to use our applications, and perform A/B testing.

A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help remember login information and site preferences. It
might also collect information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages visited, duration of visit,
content viewed, and other click-stream data. You can adjust cookie retention settings and accept or block individual
cookies in your browser settings, although our apps won’t work and other aspects of our service may not function
properly if you turn cookies off.

Note that currently all cookies on our platform (listed below) are required for it to function properly. Rejecting
cookies in our consent banner will only reject the optional cookies, including cookies that we may introduce in the
future that will not be required for the site to function (e.g., for personalization or A/B testing).

to better assist you in the future. We also store information you voluntarily provide, such as survey responses or
recordings of customer interviews (with your express consent).

  policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies). We explicitly **opt-out** of all data sharing for
  training purposes as stated in their terms.

No IllumiTacit human looks at your data except with your express permission for limited purposes, such as an
error that stops an automated process from working and requires manual intervention to fix. These are rare cases,
after which, we look for root cause solutions to avoid them recurring to the extent possible. We may also access
your data as required for legal compliance under applicable laws and regulations (see “When required under applicable law” below).

**To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.** If at any point we need to access your
content to help you with a support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.

**To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses.** Accessing your account when investigating
potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We want to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the
people reporting issues to us, and we do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we
discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will take any necessary action, including notifying appropriate authorities where warranted.

**When required under applicable law.** IllumiTacit, LLC is a U.S. company and all data infrastructure are located in the U.S.

* **Requests for user data.** Our policy is to not respond to government requests for user data unless we are compelled
  by legal process or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. However, if U.S. law enforcement
  authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us to share data, we must comply.
  Likewise, we will only respond to requests from government authorities outside the U.S. if compelled by the U.S.
  government through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. It is IllumiTacit’s policy to
  notify affected users before we share data unless we are legally prohibited from doing so, and except in some
  emergency cases.
* **Preservation requests.** Similarly, IllumiTacit’s policy is to comply with requests to preserve data only if
  compelled by the U.S. Federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f), or by a properly served U.S.
  subpoena for civil matters. We do not share preserved data unless required by law or compelled by a court order that
  we choose not to appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required
  preservation period expires, we will destroy any preserved copies of customer data at the end of the preservation
  period.
* **Audits.** If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to share billing-related information. If that
  happens, we will share only the minimum needed, such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.

Finally, if IllumiTacit, LLC is acquired by or merges with another company we’ll notify you well before any of your
personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Your Rights with Respect to Your Information

At IllumiTacit, we strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Some of these
rights include:
* **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline
  both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
* **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right
  to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
* **Right to Correction.** You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
* **Right to Erasure / “To Be Forgotten”.** This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under
  applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, from all of our
  service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using IllumiTacit services because
  our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.
* **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with
  the appropriate supervisory authority.
* **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information
  is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell
  your personal data.)
* **Right to Object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is
  processed.
* **Right to Portability.** You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to
  transmit it to another party.
* **Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making.** You have the right to object to and prevent any decision
  that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes.
  This right is limited if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by
  applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
* **Right to Non-Discrimination.** We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you
  different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy
  rights. However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using
  our Services.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and updating your account information.

If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at
[support@illumitacit.com](mailto:support@illumitacit.com).

If you are in the EU or UK, you can contact your data protection authority to file a complaint or learn more about local
privacy laws.

## How We Secure Your Data

All data are written to multiple disks instantly, backed up daily, and stored in multiple locations. Files that our
customers upload are stored on servers that use modern techniques to remove bottlenecks and points of failure.

information, you consent to this transfer.
