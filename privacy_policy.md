# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: April 6th, 2023*

The privacy of your data—and it is your data, not ours!—is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we
collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We promise we never sell your
data: never have, never will.

## What we collect and why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice:

### Identity & access

When you join the waiting list for IllumiTacit, we ask for your email address. That's so we can send you product updates
and private beta links for the service. We may also contact you to conduct a live interview to learn more about your use
case. You can unsubscribe at any time following the links in the email.

When you sign up for IllumiTacit, we ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, and maybe a
company name. That’s so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you product updates and other essential
information. We may also send you optional surveys from time to time to help us understand how you use our products and
to make improvements. With your consent, we will send you our newsletter and other updates. We sometimes also give you
the option to add a profile picture that displays in our products. You can change your notification settings at any time
through the links in the email, or on your account settings page.

We’ll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing
statements without your permission either.

### Billing information

When you sign up for IllumiTacit, you will be asked to provide your payment information and billing address. Credit card
information is submitted directly to our payment processor and doesn’t hit IllumiTacit servers. We store a record of the
payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for purposes of account history, invoicing,
and billing support. We store your billing address so we can charge you for service, calculate any sales tax due, send
you invoices, and detect fraudulent credit card transactions. We occasionally use aggregate billing information to guide
our marketing efforts.

### Product interactions

We store on our servers content that you provide during the Macro and Plugin creation process in your IllumiTacit
product account. This is so you can use our products as intended, for example, to run prompts against a language model
hosted by OpenAI. We keep this content as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we'll delete the
content within 60 days.

Content uploaded during runtime execution of Macros and Plugins are not stored on IllumiTacit servers. However, these
may be retained by our [third party service providers](#when-we-access-or-share-your-information) that provide the
language model services. For example, OpenAI will store content used for any language model for up to 30 days for abuse
detection purposes.

Refer to [service provider policies](#when-we-access-or-share-your-information) for more information on how each service
provider uses your data.

### Geolocation data

We log the full IP address used to sign up a product account and retain that for use in mitigating future spammy
signups. We also log all account access by full IP address for security and fraud prevention purposes, and we keep this
login data for as long as your product account is active.

### Website analytics

We use [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) to track overall trends in the usage of our website. Plausible
Analytics collects only aggregated information, which does not allow us to identify any visitor to our website. For more
information, please visit the [Plausible Analytics Data Policy](https://plausible.io/privacy).

### Anti-bot assessments

We proxy our service through [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to mitigate brute force and DDoS attacks. We have
a legitimate interest in protecting our apps and the broader Internet community from credential stuffing
attacks and spam. When you access IllumiTacit, Cloudflare evaluates various information (e.g., IP address, how long the
visitor has been on the app, mouse movements) to try to detect if the activity is from an automated program instead of a
human. We retain these data via our subprocessor indefinitely for use in spam mitigation.

For more information, please visit the [How Cloudflare works
page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/) and the [Cloudflare
Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

### Cookies

We use persistent first-party cookies and some third-party cookies to store login sessions, certain preferences, make it
easier for you to use our applications, and perform A/B testing.

A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help remember login information and site preferences. It
might also collect information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages visited, duration of visit,
content viewed, and other click-stream data. You can adjust cookie retention settings and accept or block individual
cookies in your browser settings, although our apps won’t work and other aspects of our service may not function
properly if you turn cookies off.

#### Third party Cookies

IllumiTacit uses the following third-party Cookies:

### Voluntary correspondence

When you email IllumiTacit with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including your email
address, so that we have a history of past correspondence to reference if you reach out in the future.

We also store information you may volunteer, for example, written responses to surveys. If you agree to a customer
interview, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We will only do so
with your express consent.

## When we access or share your information

**To provide products or services you’ve requested**. We use some third-party subprocessors to help run our applications
and provide the Services to you. The following is a list of third-party subprocessors we use:
* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/). Cloud services provider.
* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/). Cloud services provider.
* [Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/privacy/). Cloud services provider.
* [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/legal/privacy-policy/). Infrastructure and application monitoring.
* [Zitadel](https://zitadel.com/docs/legal/privacy-policy). Customer identity authentication and authorization service.
* [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/legal/gdpr). Merchant of record.
* [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/data-policy). Analytics service.
* [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/data-privacy/gdpr). Customer sales and ticketing service.
* [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-data-protection-agreement). Version control software.
* [OpenAI](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy). Language model provider. Content shared with OpenAI is over the
  API and is categorized as "API Content" as described in their [Terms of
  use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use).

No IllumiTacit human looks at your content except for limited purposes with your express permission, for example, if an
error occurs that stops an automated process from working and requires manual intervention to fix. These are rare cases,
and when they happen, we look for root cause solutions as much as possible to avoid them recurring. We may also access
your data if required in order to respond to legal process (see “When required under applicable law” below).

**To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.** If at any point we need to access your
content to help you with a support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.

**To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses.** Accessing a customer’s account when investigating
potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We want to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the
people reporting issues to us, and we do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we
discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will take action as necessary, including notifying
appropriate authorities where warranted.

**When required under applicable law.**

IllumiTacit, LLC is a U.S. company and all data infrastructure are located in the U.S.
* Requests for user data. Our policy is to not respond to government requests for user data unless we are compelled by
  legal process or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. However, if U.S. law enforcement
  authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us to share data, we must comply.
  Likewise, we will only respond to requests from government authorities outside the U.S. if compelled by the U.S.
  government through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. It is IllumiTacit’s policy to
  notify affected users before we share data unless we are legally prohibited from doing so, and except in some
  emergency cases.
* Preservation requests. Similarly, IllumiTacit’s policy is to comply with requests to preserve data only if compelled
  by the U.S. Federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f), or by a properly served U.S. subpoena for
  civil matters. We do not share preserved data unless required by law or compelled by a court order that we choose not
  to appeal. Furthermore, unless we receive a proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required preservation
  period expires, we will destroy any preserved copies of customer data at the end of the preservation period.
* If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to share billing-related information. If that happens, we
  will share only the minimum needed, such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.

Finally, if IllumiTacit, LLC is acquired by or merges with another company we’ll notify you well before any of your
personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Your rights with respect to your information

At IllumiTacit, we strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Some of these
rights include:
* **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline
  both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
* **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right
  to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
* **Right to Correction.** You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
* **Right to Erasure / “To Be Forgotten”.** This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under
  applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, from all of our
  service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using IllumiTacit services because
  our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.
* **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with
  the appropriate supervisory authority.
* **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information
  is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell
  your personal data.)
* **Right to Object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is
  processed.
* **Right to Portability.** You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to
  transmit it to another party.
* **Right to not Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making.** You have the right to object to and prevent any decision
  that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes.
  This right is limited if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by
  applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
* **Right to Non-Discrimination.** We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you
  different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy
  rights. However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using
  our Services.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and updating your account information.

If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at
[support@illumitacit.com](mailto:support@illumitacit.com).

If you are in the EU or UK, you can contact your data protection authority to file a complaint or learn more about local
privacy laws.

## How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our
servers to your browser. Any files which you upload to us are stored and are encrypted at rest. Our application
databases are encrypted at rest.

All data are written to multiple disks instantly, backed up daily, and stored in multiple locations. Files that our
customers upload are stored on servers that use modern techniques to remove bottlenecks and points of failure.

## Location of site and data

Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, UK,
or elsewhere outside of the United States, **please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred
to and stored in the United States**. By using our websites or Services and/or providing us with your personal
information, you consent to this transfer.

## Changes & questions

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. You can view a
history of the changes to our policies [on GitHub](https://github.com/illumitacit/policies/commits/main). Whenever we make
a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take any other appropriate
steps to notify users.

Have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights with respect to your
information? Please get in touch by emailing us at [support@illumitacit.com](mailto:support@illumitacit.com) and we’ll be happy to
try to answer them!
